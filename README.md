# Data Structures and Algorithms - Recursion Problems

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms problems focused on recursion. Recursion is a powerful technique in computer science where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. These problems are commonly encountered in coding interviews and are fundamental to understanding recursion.
